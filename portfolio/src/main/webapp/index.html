					Hi, welcome to Xiaohu's portfolio. In "Project", You can find the projects I have worked on. 
					You can also view some of the food I made in "Gallery". You can find my information in "About me". I mainly use 
					C++ for programming, and I have a good understanding of data structure & algorithm. 
					Below is a breif introduction of me.
				</p>
				<p class="info animate__animated animate__fadeInBottomRight animate__slow">
					A few sentences can't explain a person, just like a book cover won't tell you its content. 
					My name is "Xiaohu", it stands for little tiger in case you are curious. I used to play 
					video games a lot, mostly league of lengend, but now I focus more on my study and rarely play. 
					In my free time, I solve algorithm questions for fun. I forced myself to started it out to just 
					improve myself, but then I found it very interesting, and now it becomes a habit. Topics like bits 
					manipulation, union find and trie tree are just cool. I sometimes enjoy my time alone to just 
					think	about the world. Thank you for reading through this!
